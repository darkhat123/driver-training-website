            <p><strong>DASH</strong> Driver training is a two-man fleet of Skilled instructors, infact our name comes from
            both our instructors initials! We try not to be <b>too</b> serious during our lessons and are more than happy to share in the patter, 
            after all youre not just paying for lessons, youre paying for a patient, dedicated and friendly instructor! Thats not to say we wont be firm
            if we need you to focus we will always give a helpful nudge, only cause on test day we want your senses to be honed in and your reaction time sharp! We utilise various areas within the ayrshire district 
            to allow for the many different roads our learners will encounter on test day, making sure that they have had plenty of time and practice to become confident in each area before moving onto different manouvers and lessons!  </p>
