This is a way for me to showcase my HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP skills as i continue to develop my proficiency in web design.

I have utilised mostly HTML, CSS and Bootstrap on all pages, the only one where PHP is present is the contact form where i use it to collect the users details and parse them into the body of an email which will be passed to the mail function, this will send an email to the intended recipient on a live server. The PHP will also then check if the message has been sent , if not it will do nothing and prompt the user to correct the field entered incorrectly. Otherwise it will display a success message alongside a gif to let the user know the email has been sent.
